            <p>I still remember the first time I walked into a research panel. I initially came for the food, as I was an ordinary starving college student that couldn't pay for food. The talk was about big data and how we can deal with it moving forward. I wasn't too interested, so I sat in the back eating away. The speaker went on a pivot and began talking about breaking edge machine learning applications. My ears lifted and began absorbing each word. I was hooked. </p>

            <p>After the panel, they had poster presentations for students that have been working on their project for the past year. I walked around and spoke with many of the project managers. They told me about the hard obstacles they faced and what they would've done better if they started again. The event ultimately changed me; I ponder on the idea of diving into the research realm myself. I asked around and eventually found a research position in the computer science department. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My First Step</h2>

            <p>I was eager to dive into my first project. It was RGB light communication. We had a tablet and a poster both strapped to the back of an SUV. On the tablet and poster was an image of an RGB colored chessboard. Following the SUV was another vehicle, a sedan, with a GoPro and a Raspberry Pi camera resting on the hood. We drove the two cars for several hundred miles and collected video data of the RGB colored chessboard. I passed the data into a machine vision Matlab program that told us exactly how fast we were moving and at what distance and speed did the colors on the chessboard begin to merge. </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Second Leap</h2>

            <p>My second research project came from the honors college. Working with Haroon Qahtan, Ben Miller, and Weedah Mihran. The plan was to break down Arabic text and search it for metaphors in corpora amassed from hate speech websites and magazines. Haroon and I worked hand in hand, day and night, pushing as far as we possibly could. We contact every author who researched our similar field. We were working with breaking edge technology and hit many brick walls that surely demotivated us from moving onward. But we didn't let it stop us. </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">Personal growth is most common after personal hardship</span>

            <p>We spent countless nights binging on our research. We were working longer than we were allowed to by the honors college, but it all paid off at the end. We had a working demonstration and were able to write a paper off of the project.</p>
