            <h2 class="section-heading">Power Stems From Knowing</h2>
            
            <p>Machine learning is a very spicy word. People love to spice up their project by throwing it around unknowingly. It receives much-unwanted attention from people claiming that it will be the root of human destruction. They believe that machines will eventually be able to sprout legs and begin shooting down the human race. But we can't blame them, their only exposure to artificial intelligence is from Hollywood where they have movies like the Terminator. </p>

            <p>In hopes of breaking infamous contrary ideas about machine learning, I will elaborate on my work with the subject. I first began by watching an introduction to machine learning video from Google. They talked about Scikit Learn, a standard library used by data scientists. Then I went on to train a model on images of flowers; it was able to spit out the flower name of a flower image that it hasn't seen before. The model also gave a confidence score that tells the user how accurate it believes it is. My next mission was to train another model on images of Darth Vader, yes, Darth Vader, the superhero. </p>


            <p>I trained the model on images of Darth Vader, then fed it another image that it has never seen before, and it was able to accurately depict if Darth Vader was in the picture as well as give a confidence score. I went onto having a model read which handwritten number was given to it. So far, I was only playing around with the application, nothing too serious. That is until I decided to bring the cryptocurrency into the game.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">Machine Learning is great, but machine learning on crypto...</blockquote>


            <h2 class="section-heading">Artificial Intelligence VS. Cryptocurrency</h2>

            <p>I trained a model on massive datasets and images of previous graphs and their returns. Then I pushed it one up a notch and had it thoroughly execute trades on a larger scale amassing a fair profit. My model performed very well at the peak of the cryptocurrency rush (Dec 2017 - Jan 2018). The crash of the cryto market forced me to terminate the project. </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">“Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.” —Ginni Rometty</span>

            <p>I am now moving towards the stock market. Unlike cryptocurrency, the stock market is less volatile and much easier to predict, especially with the aid of a machine learning bot. Machine learning is a growing field, and it would be illogical to ignore it or reject it with the claim that machines will take over the world and enslave the human race. We are humans; we're better than that.</p>
